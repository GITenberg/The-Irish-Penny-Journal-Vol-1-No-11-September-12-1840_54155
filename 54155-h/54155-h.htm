<h2>CLONTARF CASTLE, COUNTY OF DUBLIN.</h2>

<p>There are few things that afford us a higher pleasure than
to observe our metropolis and our provincial cities and towns,
despite of adverse circumstances, increasing in the number
and splendour of their public buildings, for they are sure evidences
of the advance of civilization, with its attendant train
of arts, amongst us, and that we are progressing to the rank
and dignity of a great nation. Yet we confess we enjoy a
still higher gratification when we see springing up around us
great architectural works of another class&mdash;those erected by
individuals of the aristocracy as residences for themselves and
those who are to come after them. Such architectural works
are not merely interesting from the gratifications they afford
to the feeling of taste, and the epic dignity and beauty which
they contribute to landscape scenery, but have a higher interest
as pledges to the nation that those who have erected
them have a filial attachment to the soil which gave them birth,
and which supplies them, whether for good or evil, with the
means of greatness; and that they are not disposed to play
the part of unwise and ungrateful children. To us it little
matters what the creed or party of such individuals may be;
however they may err in opinions, their feelings are at heart
as they should be. The aristocrat of large means, who is resident
not from necessity but from choice, and who spends a
portion of his wealth in the adornment of his home, is rarely, if
ever, a bad landlord. Desiring to see art and nature combine
to produce the sentiment of beauty in the objects immediately
about him, he cannot willingly allow it to be associated with
the unsightly and discordant emblems of penury and sorrow.
To be indifferent about the presence of such accompaniments
would be an anomaly in human character, and only an exception
proving the general rule. It is this class of men that we
want&mdash;men who seek happiness in their legitimate homes, and
the diffusion of blessings among those to whom it is their duty
to be protectors&mdash;lovers of the arts of refined society, not the
gross and generally illiterate pursuers of field sports, which,
by hardening the heart towards the lower animals of creation,
prepares it for reckless indifference to the wants and
sufferings of our fellow men. Had we more of such patriots&mdash;more
of such domestic architectural buildings starting into
existence, evidencing as well their refined tastes and habits as
the sincerity of the love they bear their native land, we should
soon see the face of our country changed, and peace and happiness
smiling around us. We do not, however, indulge in
any feelings of despondence for the future. Very many beautiful
creations of the architectural art have recently been
erected in Ireland, and we have little apprehension that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
will not increase in number till our island shall rival any
other portion of the empire in the possession of such characteristic
features of civilization and beauty. Cheered by such
pleasing anticipations, we shall endeavour to the best of our
ability to make our readers familiar with the architectural
styles of the chief residences of our nobility and gentry, as
well as with the general features of the scenery in which they
are situated; and, as a commencement, we have selected the
seat of the Vernons&mdash;the recently re-erected Castle of Clontarf.</p>

<p>The name of this locality, which is situated on the northern
shore of the Bay of Dublin, and about two miles from the
city, must at least be familiar to most of our readers, being
memorable in history as the scene of the most national and
best contested battle ever fought in Ireland, when in 1014
the monarch Brian Boru obtained a decisive victory over the
united forces of the Danish and Norwegian invaders of the
British islands, assisted by the Irish troops of a recreant
King of Leinster. This name signifies in English the lawn or
recess of the bull, being formed from two Celtic words, <i lang="ga">cluain</i>,
a lawn or pastoral plain, and <i lang="ga">tarbh</i>, a bull; the latter appellation
expressing its contiguity to one of the two great sand-banks
of the bay, now called the North and South Bulls, from
the similitude of the sounds produced by the breaking of the
sea upon their shores, to the roar of animals of that denomination.</p>

<p>As it is stated that a church or monastery was founded here
as early as the year 550, it is probable that this name is of
ecclesiastical origin, and that the site of that ancient church
is still marked by the present parish one from which it was
derived. But, however this may be, immediately after the
settlement of the Anglo-Normans, the lands of Clontarf and
Santry, constituting one knight’s fee, were granted by Hugh
de Lacy, Lord of Meath, to one of his followers, named Adam
de Feipo, or as the name is now written, Phepoe, by whom, as
is generally supposed, the Castle of Clontarf was erected, and
its lands created a manor. This manor, as well as its castle,
appears, however, to have passed very soon after into
the possession of the Knights Templars, by whom a commandery
of the Order, dependent upon their splendid establishment
at Kilmainham, was placed here. Upon the suppression
of the Templars, their manor of Clontarf was granted,
in 1311, to Richard de Burgo, Earl of Ulster, the religious
edifices upon it remaining in the king’s hands as a royal house;
and in 1326, Roger le Ken had a grant of the premises in Clontarf,
which he had heretofore occupied at will, to hold henceforth
to him and the heirs of his body. Towards the close of
the same century, however, in obedience to the Pope’s decree
in reference to the lands of the Templars, the manor passed
into the possession of the Knights Hospitallers of St John of
Jerusalem, on which Clontarf became a preceptory of that
Order, and a chief seat of the Grand Prior of Kilmainham.
It seems somewhat probable, however, that the descendants of
Roger le Ken still continued to hold the manor as lessees of the
Hospitallers till the dissolution of the Order, as, immediately
previous to that event, on an inquisition taken, the Prior of
Kilmainham was found seised of the manor, rectory, tithes,
and altarages of Clontarf, subject, however, to a lease made
in the year 1538 to Matthew King (a corrupted form perhaps
of the name Ken) of all the town and lordship, with
the appurtenances, and also the pool of Clontarf, and the
island lying to the west side thereof, and all the said rectory,
tithes, &amp;c. to endure for nine years. In this demise
it was provided that the lessee should repair the manor-house
and maintain a sufficient person to administer all sacraments
to the parishioners at their proper charges. On the suppression
of the monastic order in the thirty-second year of Henry
the Eighth, Sir John Rawson, the Prior of Kilmainham&mdash;a
very distinguished man, who had at various periods held the
office of Treasurer of Ireland&mdash;having, with the consent of
his Chapter under their common seal, surrendered the hospital
with its dependencies into the King’s hands, he was created
Viscount of Clontarf in 1541, on a representation made
to his majesty by the Lord Deputy, with a pension of five
hundred marks, in right of which dignity he sat in the parliament
of that year.</p>

<p>In the year 1600, the manor, territory, tithes, town, and
lordships of Clontarf, as enjoyed by the Priors of Kilmainham,
were granted by Queen Elizabeth to Sir Geoffry Fenton,
who had filled the office of Secretary of State for Ireland;
and on his death in 1608 these premises were further assured
to his son Sir William, who had a confirmation of this manor
in 1637, under the commission for the remedy of defective
titles. Yet it appears that very shortly afterwards, the manor,
however acquired, was again in the possession of a member of
the King family; for, on the breaking out of the rebellion of
1641, the town, manor-house, &amp;c. of Clontarf, then the property
of Mr George King, were burnt by Sir Charles Coote
as a punishment for the supposed participation of that gentleman
in a plunder made of a cargo from a vessel which lay
there, by Luke Netterville and his adherents. King was shortly
afterwards attainted, a reward of £400 offered for his head;
and his estates, comprising this manor, Hollybrook, and the
island of Clontarf, containing, as stated, 961 acres statute
measure, were bestowed by Cromwell on Captain John Bakewell,
who afterwards sold the estate to John Vernon, a scion
of the noble Norman family of the De Vernons, and from whose
brother the present proprietor descends.</p>

<p>In 1660, Colonel Edward Vernon, the son of John Vernon,
passed patent for this manor in fee, together with all anchorages,
fisheries, creeks, sands and sea-shores, wrecks of the
sea, &amp;c.; which right was saved in subsequent acts of parliament,
and still remains to his successors. And in 1675, the
king further enlarged the jurisdictions, tenures, and courts of
this manor, with a grant of royalties (royal mines excepted),
power to empark three hundred acres, with free warren, privilege
of holding two fairs, one on the 10th of April and the
other on the 16th of October, with customs, &amp;c. These fairs
have, however, been long discontinued.</p>

<p>We have thus briefly traced the origin, and succession of
proprietors of this castle and manor, as immediately connected
with the subject of our prefixed illustration; but our limits
will not allow us to touch on the general history of the locality
on the present occasion.</p>

<p>Of the original castle erected here in the twelfth century, a
square tower, connected with additions of the sixteenth and
subsequent centuries, was preserved as a residence for the proprietors
of the manor till the year 1835, when the present
noble structure was commenced from the designs and under
the superintendence of the late William Morrison, Esq., the
most eminent and accomplished architect whom Ireland has possessed
within the present century. With the good feeling as
well as refined taste for which this admirable artist was so distinguished,
his first desire in the re-edification of this castle was
to preserve as far as possible the original buildings; and while
he increased their extent in the necessary additions to them,
to preserve and restore them as much as possible to what
might be supposed to have been their original state. But it
was found impracticable to do so. The foundations were found
to have sunk, and a nearly total re-erection was therefore necessary;
yet, in the new edifice, attending to the historical
associations connected with a spot so interesting, he so designed
it as to exhibit with historical accuracy what might
be supposed to have been the forms and features of the ancient
buildings, and thus make it a consistent commentary on and
illustration of the past history of its locality.</p>

<p>With these remarks, which were necessary to insure a just
appreciation of the intention of the architect in the diversified
character which he has given to this architectural composition,
we may describe it generally as a structure in its character
partly military, partly domestic, and to a certain extent ecclesiastical.
Its grand feature is a tower in the Norman style of
the twelfth century, which ascends to the height of seventy
feet, or with a smaller tower which is placed behind it, eighty
feet: it has turrets at its angles, and its windows as well
as its interior are enriched with decorations in harmony with
its architectural style. Connected with this tower, and placed
on its west side, is the principal portion of the domestic buildings,
which present the purest specimen, perhaps, of Tudor
architecture to be found in Ireland. The entrance to this
range is placed beneath a small but lofty tower, beneath
which a vestibule leads into a spacious and lofty hall, fifty-one
feet by twenty, which presents much the appearance of
a Gothic church, the walls being panelled, and painted to
imitate dark oak. This hall is floored with Irish oak polished,
and its roof is supported by principals springing from richly
ornamented corbels, or pendants&mdash;its beauty being much increased
by gilded bosses with which it is studded, and which,
sparkling among the dark tracery, have a singularly rich effect.
The cornice is also richly ornamented, and presents at intervals
similar gilded bosses. But the imposing feature of this
great chamber is a magnificent staircase of oak, placed at its
eastern end, which leads, by two return flights, to a gallery
crossing the hall, and communicating with the principal bed-chambers,
and which would serve for an orchestra on occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of festivity. At the other end of the hall are doors leading
into the drawing-room, dancing-room, and library; and in the
centre of this end is placed a beautiful chimney-piece of black
marble, surrounded by a canopy of carved oak, the enrichments
of which are in that peculiar style which characterises
the ornaments of Tudor architecture, containing the single
and double rose, stars, and other badges of that period. The
hall is lighted by five stained glass windows of an ecclesiastical
character, and level with the gallery; and on these
windows are blazoned the arms of the families with whom the
Vernons have intermarried, comprising some of the highest of
the English and Irish nobility. Of the external architecture
of this portion of the building some correct notion may be
formed from our illustration, which exhibits the style of the
gables and oriel or bay windows which are placed both on its
southern and western sides; and we may justly apply to the
whole of this range the description given by Chaucer in his
imaginary palace of “pleasaunt regarde:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The chamberis and parlers of a sorte,</div>
<div class="verse">With bay windows goodlie as may be thought,</div>
<div class="verse">The galleries right wele y wrought,</div>
<div class="verse">As for dauncinge and otherwise disporte.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Branching from the northern and eastern sides of the great
tower, extensive ranges of building contain the servants’
apartments, and an extensive suite of inferior bed-rooms, and
the tower itself contains a study, and above it a nursery, over
which, again, a leaded platform with parapets commands most
extensive and diversified prospects of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>The preceding description will, we fear, convey but an imperfect
idea of the plan of this interesting structure, nor will
our illustration, which only gives a representation of its southern
front, give more than a general idea of the architectural
character of a building, the great merit of which, next to the
beauty and chronological accuracy of its details, consists in
the number of picturesque points of view which it affords,
from the irregularity of its plan and the variety of its outlines.</p>

<p>We shall only add a few words in respect to its locality.</p>

<p>The Castle of Clontarf is situated in a district rich in pastoral
beauty, and at the head or northern extremity of the
village of the same name, which consists of a single but wide
street composed of houses of a respectable class, and extending
from it in a right line to the sea. It is surrounded by forest
trees of great age and grandeur, through which by vistas are
obtained views of the bay and the mountain scenery of the
southern shore.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, we may truly say of this structure that its
beauty is no less striking than its moderate size and pretension
are in happy proportion to the rank and means of its owner;
nor is it a lesser merit, that&mdash;unlike too many of the lordly
residences in Ireland&mdash;the close propinquity of its situation to
the village of which he is lord, is characteristically expressive
of the confidence and kindly familiarity which should ever
exist between the proprietor and the community holding under
him. Nor is it again a lesser merit, that&mdash;unlike most of the
mansion-houses to which we have alluded&mdash;it is not enclosed by
churlish and prison-like walls of stone, excluding it from the
public eye, and indicating but too truly the cold and heartless
selfishness of their owners, which would not allow to the
many even the passing enjoyment of a glimpse of the grandeur
and beauty which they claim as their own.</p>

<p class="right">P.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">A Wooden Glass Goblet.</span>&mdash;The first night of the
“Stratford Jubilee” in Dublin, Robert Mahon had to sing
the song of the “Mulberry Tree,” the music composed by C.
Dibdin senior, the words of which begin with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Behold, this fair goblet was carved from the tree</div>
<div class="verse">Which, oh! my sweet Shakespeare, was planted by thee.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He walked on, and began the song, holding out in his hand a
fine cut-glass rummer. The other performers, who were also
on, looked at him and his fair <em>glass</em> goblet “carved from a
tree” with wonder. The audience took the absurdity, and
much mirth and loud hissing followed. The play over,
Mahon had the folly to insist upon it he was right: “’Tis
true,” he said, “the property-man did stand at the wing with
a wooden cup in his hand, which he wanted to thrust into
mine; but could I appear before the audience with such a
rascally vulgar wooden mether?&mdash;no; I insisted he should
that instant go and fetch me an elegant glass rummer, and
here it is!”&mdash;<cite>O’Keefe’s Recollections.</cite></p>




<h2 class="gap4" id="CUTTING_OLD_FRIENDS">CUTTING OLD FRIENDS.</h2>


<p>One of the most difficult things a person has to do, who is
getting ahead of the friends of his earlier and less prosperous
years in the race of fortune, is to rid himself of these friends&mdash;to
get quit of persons whose want of success in the world
renders them no longer fit associates. The thing is not
easily done, for you have to maintain appearances. You have
to repel them gradually and gently, and in such a manner as
to be able to defy them to lay any particular act of rudeness,
any positive act of repulsion, to your charge. To manage the
thing adroitly, therefore, requires some genius and a good
deal of tact.</p>

<p>The difficulty of accomplishing this great manœuvre in a
prosperous career, is much increased by the circumstance that
as you advance your ancient cronies throng the thicker and
closer around you. They in fact cling and cluster about you
like so many bees, and with impertinent looks of glee seek to
express their satisfaction with your prosperity.</p>

<p>Now, it is a most desirable thing to get quit of these gentry&mdash;to
have them brushed off. But it would be rude to do
this with the fly-flap and the strong hand. You must get rid
of them by more tact and management. And after you have
got rid of them, that is, driven them from personal contact as
it were, you have to continue to keep them at a proper distance.
No easy matter this, for somehow or other the obtuse
creatures, your poor former acquaintance, will not see, what
you see very distinctly, that you are now quite a superior sort
of person to them, and that they are no longer fit to be ranked
amongst your friends. This the perverse, dull-witted fellows
will not see. And, more provoking still, no degree of advancement
in the world on your part, no acquisition of wealth,
will induce one of them, whatever you yourself may think to
the contrary, to contemplate you with a whit more respect
than they did when you were one of themselves. They insist on
considering you merely as having been more fortunate than
themselves&mdash;not a bit better or a bit cleverer.</p>

<p>Let us remark here, that the successful in the world are
stout deniers of the doctrine of chances. They maintain that
there is no such a thing as luck; while the unsuccessful, again,
are firm believers in the doctrine, and insist on it that not
only is there such a thing as luck, but that luck is every thing.
The successful man’s vanity prompts him to attribute his
prosperity solely to his talents and merit&mdash;the unsuccessful
man’s self-love to deny that the want of these qualities has
been his hindrance. Hence the conflicting opinions of the two
on this curious subject. Then, where lies the truth? We
suspect between.</p>

<p>From a good deal of experience in the science of “cutting”
under the circumstances alluded to in this paper&mdash;we shall not
say whether as cutters or cuttees&mdash;we have flattered ourselves
that we could throw out a few hints that might be found useful
to gentlemen who are getting on in the world, and who are
desirous of ridding themselves of their earlier and poorer
friends. Under this supposition we offer the few following
remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>For some time after you have started on the prosperous
career on which you have luckily fallen, continue to smile and
bow towards your old friends as formerly; and when you
meet them accidentally (let this be, however, as seldom as you
possibly can), shake hands with them as cordially as ever.
You may even venture to remark, accompanying such remark
with an expression of regret, that they are prodigious strangers
now. But this is not quite safe ground, and we by no
means advise its general adoption. Conducting yourself in
this way, your old friends will never suspect that there is already
a change working at your heart&mdash;a secret operation as
yet known only to yourself.</p>

<p>By and bye, throw the least, the very least thing of distance
into your greeting: let your smile be <em>apparently</em> as cordial as
formerly, but let there now be a slight expression of the
slightest degree possible of coolness, of an indefinable something
or other in your general manner of a repulsive character: take
care, however, that it <em>be</em> indefinable&mdash;that it be of
a description that cannot be named.</p>

<p>This new feature in your bearing will probably startle the
more shrewd and observant of your former friends: but never
mind that&mdash;it is precisely the impression you desire to make.
It is even possible that some of them may express by <em>their</em>
manner towards <em>you</em> a feeling of irritation at your new mode
of treating them. Meet it by an expression of surprise at
<em>their</em> conduct, and by increased coolness. There is now good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
ground for a quarrel&mdash;not open hostility, of course, but the
warfare of distant looks and haughty salutations. Improve
it to the utmost, and wonder what the fellows mean.</p>

<p>Observe that the whole of this nice process of dissolving
former associations is carried on without one angry or offensive
word being said on either side&mdash;without the slightest
approach to an overt act of hostility; you, particularly, being as
bland as ever. The whole is effected by look and manner alone.</p>

<p>To the gentleman who is rising in the world there are few
things more offensive than the familiarity of old acquaintanceship
when presented in the shape of notes and letters. Your
old friends, still obstinately overlooking your advancement
in the world, will in all probability continue to write to you
when they have occasion to do so, in the free-and-easy way of
former days. They will even sometimes so far forget themselves
and you as to address you in a jocular strain. This
must be instantly put down. Do it by brief and grave replies;
take no notice of their jokes, and never attempt an approach
to one in return. This in time will cure them: if not, you
must have recourse to stronger measures. You must either
not answer at all, or administer some decided dampers.</p>

<p>Should any of your former friends seek your patronage&mdash;a
very probable case&mdash;take an early opportunity, while doing
him some trifling service, of letting him feel sensibly your
relative positions, all the while, however, exhibiting towards
him the most friendly dispositions. But let him ever and
anon feel the bit gently&mdash;let him feel that he has got somebody
on his back. Begin as soon as possible to lecture him in a
gentle way&mdash;all for his own good of course. Your character
of patron gives you a right to do this; and under this guise
you can say the most cutting things to him without affording
him the slightest ground for complaint. Under this guise you
can address the most insulting language to him, and defy him
to take it amiss. If he should, however, you can without any
difficulty prove him to be one of the most ungrateful monsters
that ever lived. You were doing all you could for him, and
when you ventured to <em>advise</em> him&mdash;having nothing but his own
good at heart&mdash;he chose to take offence at you, and to resent
the friendly advice you gave him. Such an ungrateful dog!</p>

<p>As few men can stand such treatment as that above alluded
to long, we can venture to promise you that by a steady course
of proceeding in the way we have pointed out, you will soon
clear your hands of your old friends.</p>

<h2 class="gap4" id="OROHOO_THE_FAIRY_MAN">OROHOO, THE FAIRY MAN,<br />
A REMINISCENCE OF CONNAUGHT.</h2>

<p>Were we to believe the chronicles of our grandmothers, Ireland
at one period was held in fee-simple by witches, warlocks,
white ladies, fairies, and leprahauns; the earth, the air, and
the sky, were peopled by them; every crumbling and desolate
cabin on the sterile moor or common was tenanted by a witch;
while the margins of our beautiful loughs, the bosoms of our
silent and sequestered glens, the recesses of our romantic
mountain valleys, the echoing walls of every mouldering edifice,
and the mystic circle of each rude hill-fort, were the chosen
habitations of unearthly beings.</p>

<p>Nor was this belief held by the uneducated alone; many
who moved in respectable situations in society were infected
by it; and otherwise sensible and well-informed people on this
head were deaf to the voice of reason and the dictates of common
sense, and would as soon doubt the truth of Holy Writ
as the existence of supernatural agency; and so interwoven
was the superstition in the social system, that no event could
happen poor mortality from the cradle to the grave, in which
the <em>good people</em> were not implicated for good or evil. Did the
head or a member of a leading family die, the wail of the banshee
was sure to be heard in the twilight. Was a favourite
child smitten with disease, the beautiful, the beloved one was
believed to be changed for a squalling, ravenous, and decrepid
starveling. Did your cattle pine, or was your dairy not productive,
your cows were either elf-shot or bewitched. Was
the wife of your bosom snatched away in her bloom, in the
most interesting though dangerous moment of her existence,
the fairies were whispered to be the authors of your misfortune&mdash;to
have spirited her off, and to have left in her stead a
wooden substitute.</p>

<p>Well do I remember the thrill of fear, mingled with a degree
of pleasurable awe, with which I listened some forty years
since to the narratives of a venerable aunt, who was lingering
out the evening of her existence at my father’s fireside&mdash;her
only occupation being, rocking the cradle and keeping the
youngsters from mottling their shins. She was an experienced
dame, and withal pious, but would as soon doubt her own
identity as that of witches and fairies, and her memory was
well stored with instances of their interference. These I then
believed most implicitly, particularly as in many of them “the
family” was concerned. She could relate how her grandfather
one morning detected a hare in the act of milking one of his
cows, which he fired at and wounded, and on tracking the
blood, discovered it to flow from the thigh of an old crone who
inhabited a neighbouring hovel. She also could tell how an
elder brother had surprised a leprahaun in the act of making
shoes for the gentle people&mdash;could describe his dress minutely,
and how he had escaped captivity by making a feint with his
awl at my uncle’s eye, and causing him to wink when in the
very act of seizing him, and thereby marred his fortune. She
also knew a child which was taken from its mother’s arms at
night, but luckily was missed before he could be conveyed
through the key-hole, and on the outcry of the bereaved
parent, was dropped “with a whack” on the floor uninjured.
It never occurred to her that probably the child had rolled out
of the bed accidentally. There was another tale often related
by her, which it would be worse than heresy to doubt, as she
knew the parties intimately.</p>

<p>An honest man named John M’Kinstrey, who resided near
Maheraveely, in the county Monaghan, was once compelled
to leave his warm bed in “the witching time of night,” on a
certain pressing occasion, and ride post-haste for a worthy
dame whose assistance was indispensable. While returning
with the “howdy” safely stowed on an ample pillion behind,
he heard the strokes of an axe reverberating through a neighbouring
wood, and voices in conversation. Curiosity prompted
him to draw up and listen, when he distinctly heard the question
asked, “What are you doing to-night?” and to his dismay
the answer was responded, “I’m making a wife for Jack
M’Kinstrey.” “Faith,” said Jack, “you’ll make no wife for
me, my man&mdash;I’ll do very well with the one I have;” and giving
his good beast the spur, regardless of the neck, bones, or outcry
of his freight, he never drew rein until he had his better half
clasped in his arms, where he held her in a death’s-grip until
the crisis was over, and thus baulked the fairies.</p>

<p>Thus was the whole system of society pervaded by the idea
of supernatural influence; and the consequence was an undefinable
dread and fear, hanging like the sword of Damocles
over the heads of all, and embittering existence. ’Tis true
the evil was only imaginary, but not on that account the less
hurtful; for, being a mental malady, it was the more difficult
to be counteracted or eradicated, and often led to real anxiety
and distress, as in the care of M’Kinstrey, whose ideas being
full of witchcraft and fairy freaks, never reflected that the
noise and voices he had heard might be a practical joke of
some of his neighbours, and in consequence suffered all the
suspense and trouble incident to real danger.</p>

<p>But the diffusion of useful knowledge and the dissemination
of sound education among all classes, has latterly effected a
mighty change in the intellectual powers of the people. Such
reveries as those referred to, though sometimes used to “adorn
a tale,” are now unheeded; and there are few indeed who
would harbour for a moment in sincerity the absurd idea of
evil agency. There may be, ’tis true, some exceptions&mdash;a
few old women may be still haunted by the sprites of other
days, and in some remote districts a belief in witchcraft certainly
prevails, ingrafted by early prejudices, and fostered
and kept alive by the practices of knaves, who profess to avert
the effects by counter-charms, and live, like many others, on
the credulity of the public; but, generally speaking, the
thing is defunct&mdash;gone to the moles and the bats.</p>

<p>But there is an exception. In several districts in Ireland,
in Connaught especially, an idea is very prevalent that it
is in the power of evil-disposed persons to deprive their
neighbours of their milk or butter. This is said to be done
in various ways, the most usual being the use of a corpse
hand, which is kept shrivelled and dried to stir the milk and
gather the butter. Another plan is to follow the cows on a
May morning, and gather the soil which drops from between
their cloots. Another, by collecting the froth which forms
on a stream running through their pasture, and milking your
own cow on it. Indeed, the means used are represented to be
so simple, that the very absurdity of the matter is its own
refutation.</p>

<p>Yet it is believed in, and that firmly; and in order to prove
that such is the case, and also expose the trickery and legerdemain
by which some knaves succeed in throwing dust in
the eyes of the natives, I will relate an occurrence in which I
was concerned; and to open the matter fully in all its ramifications,
windings, and train of circumstantials, I trust I will
be pardoned if I enter into a rather minute detail, the rather as
I confess I was for a short time myself almost inclined to credit
its existence&mdash;in short, believed myself the dupe of a fairy
man.</p>

<p>Some time since I resided in the neighbourhood of the
“plains of Boyle,” a celebrated pasture country, and was the
possessor of a cow whose milk and butter were plentiful in
quantity and excellent in quality, and materially contributed
to the comforts of my family. She was a beautiful and a
gentle creature; and I flattered myself that in her I possessed
the foundress of a numerous herd, and the germ of a profitable
and extensive dairy.</p>

<p>As before observed, the idea was very prevalent there that
it was in the power of evil-disposed persons to deprive you of
your milk and butter, and I heard many complaints of the kind;
the general voice fastened the imputation on a woman who
lived in the vicinity, who was locally termed “the Hawk,” and
certainly the fire of her eye and the sharpness of her beak
justified the appellation: she was a comely middle-aged person,
in rather easy circumstances, her husband being a small farmer;
but he lay under the suspicion of being concerned in a murder
some time before. She was a reputed witch, and the entire
family were disliked and avoided.</p>

<p>One morning in the month of January, I was informed that
a woman had come into my kitchen, who occupied herself in
watching the motions of the family, without stating her business.
On going down, I found her well dressed and well
looking, but with a very sinister cast of countenance. On
asking if she wanted me, she said she had heard I was in want
of some geese, and that she had a few to dispose of. “How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
many?” said I. “A goose and a gander,” she replied. “How
much do you want for them?” “Seven-and-sixpence.”
“Seven-and-sixpence!” I exclaimed in surprise, as the usual
price then was from one shilling to one-and-sixpence each.
“Why, how many have you?” as I really thought I had made
a mistake in the number. “A goose and a gander,” said she.
“And do you suppose me to be a goose to give such a price as
that?” said I. “Oh!” said she, “they are good geese, and
only I wish to serve you, I would not offer them at all.”
“Indeed! I am much obliged by your good wishes,” said I;
“but as I think you want to impose upon me, you must take
your geese to another market, for I will not have them at any
price, and the sooner you take yourself off the better.” She
got highly offended, muttered something about my being sorry
for refusing them, and went away in high dudgeon; and after
she was gone, I found it was “the Hawk” who had favoured
me with the visit.</p>

<p>On the same morning, a gang of strollers, consisting of tinkers,
chimney-sweeps, a brace or two of beggars, and a piper,
had pitched their tent on the road side, a short distance from my
residence; the members of the party had distributed themselves
over the surrounding district in pursuit of their various avocations;
it also happened to be churning-day, and my wife having
set her vessels in order, was proceeding with her lacteal
operations favourably&mdash;the milk had cracked, the butter was
expected&mdash;when the sound of music was heard; the piper attached
to the party had come to give us a specimen of his skill; he
favoured us with a few Connaught planxties, was duly rewarded,
and departed. Shortly after he was gone, two buxom
baggages, brown and bare-legged, with cans in their hands,
kerchiefs on their heads, and huge massive rings on their fingers,
came and demanded an alms. They were told there was
nothing then ready, on which one of them asked a drink. “I
have nothing to offer you but water,” said my wife, “until
the churning’s done.” “Well, water itself,” said she; on
getting which, she took a sup or two, put the remainder in
her can, and went off; and, strange as it may seem, my butter
went too. And from that day in January until May eve following,
not a morsel had we from our beautiful Brownie.</p>

<p>As I did not put any faith in witchcraft, I was willing to attribute
this to some natural cause affecting the cow, though the
milk showed no perceptible change in either quantity or quality;
neither did she exhibit any symptoms of ailment or disorder,
except that she began to cast her hair. She was well supplied
with good fodder, comfortably lodged, and well attended,
and every possible care taken of the milk, but all to no purpose;
the butter was not forthcoming; and for my incredulity
I was laughed at by my neighbours. “Your cow is bewitched,”
cried they; “and you may as well throw chaff against the
wind, as think you will get your butter back, till you get the
charm.” Some said “the Hawk” had it, some that the gipsy
took it away in her can, and others that it followed the piper.
Be that as it may, I had to eat my bread butterless, and brood
over my loss, without even the comfort of common condolence.</p>

<p>Various were the counter-charms recommended for my
adoption. “Send for Fraser the Scotchman from beyond the
Lough,” said one; “he fears neither man nor fiend, and he
will surely get it.” “Send for ‘the Hawk,’ and clip a bit off
her ear,” said another. “Let them keep their mouths full of
water, and never speak while they are churning,” said a third.
In short, I found there were as many ways of getting it back,
as there were of losing it&mdash;all equally simple, and probably as
efficacious.</p>

<p>Thus matters continued until the early part of the month
of April, when one morning a man called, who desired to see
me. I found him a light, active, cute-looking fellow, low in
stature and spare in habit, but sinewy, well set and well
knit, and regularly smoke-dried. He was pretty well clad in
frieze, cord breeches, and yarn stockings and pumps; his
caubeen on one side, a cutty in his mouth, and a certain jauntiness
in his air, and crafty audacity in his look, which seemed
to say, “I’d have you to know I’m a clever fellow.”</p>

<p>“So,” said he at once without preamble, “so you’ve lost
your butter.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “’tis certainly gone.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you like, I’ll get it for you. My name is <span class="smcap">Orohoo</span>
(O’Hara); I live at Sliev Bawn&mdash;the people call me the
Fairy man&mdash;I can find things that’s stole&mdash;and I keep the
<em>garvally</em>.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said I: “why, you must be a clever fellow: but
can you get my butter?”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it,” said he, “if it is in the country.”</p>

<p>I had heard of the garvally before, which was described as
“a crooked thing like the handle of an umbrella, covered with
green baize.” It was formerly in much repute for swearing
on; “and a terrible thing it was, for if you swore falsely and
it round your neck, your mouth would turn to the back of
your head, or you’d get such a throttling as you’d never get
the better of.” It had latterly, however, lost much of its virtue,
or rather of its fame, by an unbelieving vagabond yoking
it on and swearing to a manifest falsehood, without suffering
any visible inconvenience. But to return to Orohoo.</p>

<p>He made no stipulation; but requiring a deep plate, some
water and salt, with a little of the cow’s milk, he commenced
by desiring my wife and me to stand forward. He then asked
our names, if I was the owner of the cow, how long I had had
her, if that woman was my wife, when we had lost our butter,
and if we suspected any person for taking it. To these queries
I answered as was necessary; but to the last I replied,
I did not believe in witchcraft.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe in fairies?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Scarcely,” said I.</p>

<p>“No matter,” said he; “maybe before I’m done you will
believe in them.”</p>

<p>He then in a very solemn manner poured some water into
the plate at three several times, thus&mdash;“In the name of the
Father,” a drop; “in the name of the Son,” ditto; “in the
name of the Holy Ghost,” ditto. He added the milk in the
same manner, and then sprinkled in the salt, using the same
formula. He now stirred round the mixture three times with
his finger, repeating the words as before, and desired us to
do the same. To this I demurred, for I did not wish to evince
any faith in the proceeding, by taking an active part; but he
combated my scruples by asking “was it not done in a good
name?” Certainly for so far I saw nothing very objectionable,
and my wife feeling no scruple on the subject, at their joint
persuasion I did as directed.</p>

<p>He next made the sign of the cross over the plate with his
hands, and, waving them over his head, cut several curious
figures in the air, at the same time muttering an unintelligible
jargon I could not understand, but which, as I could catch a
sound or syllable, bore a close affinity to what is called bog
Latin. Gradually he became much excited; he raved like a
demon, stamped with his feet, and threatened with his fists:
now his tones were those of supplication or entreaty, anon of
abjuration or command; while his eye seemed fixed upon and
to follow the motions of some to us invisible being, with which
he appeared to hold converse. Suddenly he gave an unearthly
scream, as if in an agony of terror and perturbation, and,
holding up his hands as in the act of warding off a threatened
danger, he retreated backwards round the room, pursued, as
it seemed, by an implacable enemy. Gradually he regained
the spot he had left, turned himself to the four cardinal points,
making the sign of the cross at each turn, dipped his fingers
in the mixture, devoutly blessed himself, anointing his forehead,
shoulders, and breast, regained his self-possession,
raised his hands and eyes in an attitude of fervent thankfulness
to heaven, wiped the perspiration which profusely streamed
from his brow with the cuff of his coat, gradually recovered
his breath, and from a state of the greatest possible excitement
became calm and collected.</p>

<p>Now, this was all acting, to be sure, but it was inimitably
done, and I confess, even armed as I was with unbelief, it
made a very powerful impression on me. I acknowledge I
did not feel at all comfortable. I did not like the idea of being
in the same room with the evil one, who to all appearance
was chasing my friend the conjuror round and round it. I
felt an indescribable sensation of dread creeping over me, and,
if I mistake not, there were a few drops of perspiration on my
brow; and my hair, of which I have not a superabundance, to
my apprehension began to get stiff and wiry. My wife, too,
clung closely to my side for protection, and the agitation of
her mind was evident by the audible action of her heart,
which in that case beat only responsive to my own.</p>

<p>Having taken breath, he asked for a ribbon, which he passed
over his forehead and round his head, and, bringing the ends
in front, knotted it over his nose; then twining it round his
fingers in the manner children call a cat’s cradle, he knelt
down and peered through it attentively into the mixture,
which I imagined at the moment fermented and sent up a blue
vapour. After gazing a few seconds in this manner,</p>

<p>“Aha!” said he, “she is not far off that has your butter;
bring me a lighted candle,” which on being brought he placed
in the plate. “Now,” said he, “both of you kneel down; do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
as I do, and say as I say, and we’ll have her here directly.”</p>

<p>“No,” said I decidedly, “we will not.”</p>

<p>I thought we had gone far enough, and was convinced that
if what we were engaged in was not an unholy act, it was at
least a piece of gross deception, and I would not countenance
it by any further participation.</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed he, “don’t you want to get your butter?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “I would like to have my butter, but I
don’t choose to resort to a charm to obtain it.”</p>

<p>“No doubt this is a charm,” said he, “but it is done in a
good name; and I have done it before for as good as ever you
were.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse,” I replied; “that holy name should
never be profaned in such a manner, and I am sorry any person
would be so wicked or so foolish as to encourage you in
your tricks. I neither like you nor your proceedings, and the
sooner you go about your business the better.”</p>

<p>He started to his feet in a passion, blew out the candle,
seized the plate, and attempted to throw the contents into the
fireplace; but my wife, who did not wish her hearth to be wet,
took it from him and laid it past. He fumed and stormed,
said I let him take a great deal of trouble on my account, and
insisted on proceeding; but I was determined, and, being considerably
chafed and annoyed by the transaction, I again
ordered him off, and left him.</p>

<p>In a few moments I heard the noise of a violent altercation
and scuffle, and I was loudly called on. I hastened to the
scene of contention, and found my wife holding Orohoo by the
neck, and preventing his departure. “What’s all this?” I exclaimed.
“This fellow,” said she, “when he was going, took a live
coal out of the grate, and told me to take care of my children.”
This he stiffly denied, until confronted by the servant, and I
threatened to give him up to the police as an impostor, when
he quailed, and acknowledged that he had said so, but that he
meant no harm by it. “And sure,” said he, “there’s no harm
in bidding you mind them; for if your cow was hurt, so may
your children. You’re not treating me well,” he continued;
“I came at the bidding of a friend to do you a good turn, and
asked nothing for it, and now you’re putting me out; you’ll be
glad to see me yet, though. But take my advice: never
throw out your Sunday’s ashes until Tuesday morning, and
always sweep your floor in from the door to the hearth.” And
away he went.</p>

<p>My heart now beat easy, for I thought we had fairly got rid
of the fairy man; but I was to be still further mystified and
bewildered. On examining the plate over which he had performed
his incantations, we found the contents to be thick,
yellow, and slimy, with a red sediment like globules of blood at
the bottom. This seemed extraordinary, as I certainly watched
him closely, and did not see him put any thing into the plate
but milk, water, and salt.</p>

<p>The month now drew near a close, and our bread was still
butterless. This often caused the morsel to stick in the
throat of my poor dear partner, who felt none of the scruples
of conscience with which I was affected, and firmly believed,
her cow was bewitched. “Here we are day after day losing,
our substance, and might have it only for your squeamishness
in not letting the fairy man finish his job.” Thus she would
argue, and hesitated not to call me a fool, nay, a downright
ass; and indeed my neighbours were much of the same opinion:
one of them, a respectable farmer’s wife, was particularly pertinacious.
“My Robin,” said she one evening, as they were
harping on the old string, “my Robin was down in Sligo, and
he heard that if you got the coulter of a plough, and made
it red-hot in the fire, while you were churning the butter
would come back; or if you chose to churn on Sunday morning
before the lark sings, you will surely get it.” “Tempt me
no more with your spells or Sabbath-breaking; I will have
none of them,” said I, impatiently; “I will never barter my
peace of mind for a pound of butter, if I should never eat a
morsel.”</p>

<p>But, in truth, my peace of mind was gone, for the continual
urging and yammering I was subjected to made me heartily
sick, and I inwardly resolved to sell the cow the first opportunity,
and so end the matter.</p>

<p>On May eve, in the afternoon, I had occasion to leave home
for a short time, and on my return was rather surprised to
find all the windows closed and the door locked against me. I
knocked and called for admittance, but received no answer;
and hearing the noise of churning going on within, “fast and
furious,” the truth flashed across my mind; and lamenting my
wife’s credulity, I retired to the garden to await the result.
In a short time she came running out like one demented, clapping
her hands and screaming, “Oh! we’ve got the butter,
we’ve got the butter!” and on going in I found a coulter phizzing
and sparkling at a white heat in the fire, an ass’s shoe
(which had been found a few days previously) under the churn,
my worthy neighbour aforesaid standing over it, panting and
blowing from the exertions she had made on my behoof, and
wiping the dew-drops from her really comely countenance, and
in the churn, floating like lumps of gold in a sea of silver, as
fine a churning of butter as ever we were blessed with.</p>

<p>Well, I own I was staggered, and being triumphantly asked,
“Now, is there no witchcraft or virtue in a red-hot coulter?”
I could scarcely muster up courage to utter “No.” In vain
I protested the butter came back because “Brownie” got back
to her pasture, in consequence of the change in her feeding,
from dry fodder to the mellow and genial produce of spring,
as the loss at first was owing to the transition from grass to
hay. ’Twas to no purpose to argue thus: all else were
positive it was otherwise; but whether the virtue was in
Orohoo’s incantations, the efficacy of the red-hot coulter, the
influence of the ass’s shoe, or the tremendous pommelling
the milk was subjected to on the occasion, no one could exactly
say.</p>

<p>A few days after, I conversed on the subject with an intelligent
person, a herd in charge of an extensive stock farm.
After hearing my story to an end, he indulged in a hearty
laugh at my expense. “Faith,” said he, “I took you for a
sensible man, and did not suppose you would credit such
folly.” “I’d as soon believe my mother was a bishop,” said I,
“as put any faith in it some time ago. But how can I get
over the chain of circumstantial evidence?&mdash;not a link of it
wanting. First, ‘the Hawk’ coming with her seven-and-sixpenny
geese, then the gipsies and the piper, and losing
my butter just then.” “’Tis very easy,” said he, “to account
for it. In the first place, you took your cow from grass
and fed her on hay.” “Yes, but she had plenty of winter
cabbage, and we gave her boiled potatoes.” “Just the thing;
cabbage is good for plenty of milk, but not for butter. I’ll
engage you gave her the potatoes warm.” “Yes.” “And
she got a scour?” “Indeed she did, and her hair fell off.”
“So I thought. And afterwards she got in good condition?”
“Yes.” “Oh! ay, she put her butter on her ribs. Did you
kill a pig at Christmas?” “I did.” “Where did you put
your bacon in press?” “Why, under the shelf in the dairy.”
“Now the murder is out! Never as long as you live put
meat, either fresh or salt, near your milk-vessels; if you do,
you will surely spoil your milk and lose your butter.” “This
may account for my loss, but what have you to say to its
coming back?” “Why, what’s to hinder it, when your bacon
is in the chimney and your cow at grass?” “But the red
blobs in the plate, and Orohoo fighting the devil for me, what
do you say to that?” Here he gave way to such a violent fit
of laughter that I really thought he would burst the waistband
of his doe-skins. “Orohoo! ha! ha!&mdash;Orohoo! ha!
ha! ha!&mdash;the greatest villain that ever breathed. He came
to me one time that I had a cow sick, and said she was fairy-smitten,
and that he would cure her. He began with his
tricks with the milk and water, just the same as he did with
you; but I watched him closer; and when I saw the smoke
rising out of the plate, I got him by the neck, shook a little
bottle of vitriol out of the cuff of his coat, and took a paper
of red earthy powder out of his waistcoat pocket.” I looked
aghast and confounded. Was I, then, the dupe of the fairy
man? The thought was humiliating, and I even wished that
I had remained in ignorance, but on reflection had reason to
congratulate myself that it was only a temporary lapse, and
that I was right in my original opinion, that, except the
witchery of a pair of blue languishers, or the fairy spell of a
silver-tongued syren, there is now no evil of the kind to be
apprehended.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Fashion is a poor Vocation.</span>&mdash;Its creed, that idleness is
a privilege, and work a disgrace, is among the deadliest errors.
Without depth of thought, or earnestness of feeling, or strength
of purpose, living an unreal life, sacrificing substance to show,
substituting the fictitious for the natural, mistaking a crowd for
society, finding its chief pleasure in ridicule, and exhausting
its ingenuity in expedients for killing time, fashion is among

<h2 class="gap4" id="THE_MAGNETIC_POLES">THE MAGNETIC POLES.</h2>

<p>The unwearied spirit of scientific research which so peculiarly
marks the times in which we live, has ascertained the
positions of the northern and southern magnetic poles to a degree
of almost mathematical precision. This discovery will
be hailed with pleasure by every person at all acquainted with
the benefits derived to society by the labours of those gifted
individuals who have devoted their thoughts more particularly
to the study of this most abstruse and mysterious branch of
physical knowledge. The position of the northern magnetic
pole was determined by Sir John Ross, in his second northern
expedition, fitted out at the sole expense of a British merchant,
to be in 70 degrees 5 minutes 17 seconds north latitude,
and 96 degrees 46 minutes 45 seconds west longitude, near the
western coast of the newly discovered tract named, after the
individual through whose munificence the boundaries of science
have been thus enlarged, Boothia Felix. Its place is
now marked on the globes and maps of the world published
since the navigator’s announcement of the solution of this long-sought-for
problem. The day of the discovery was the 1st of
June 1831.</p>

<p>The position of the southern magnetic pole has not yet been
ascertained to so great a degree of precision. Excited by a
noble spirit of emulation caused by the success of the expedition
fitted out by Mr Booth and led by Sir John Ross, three
expeditions have been fitted out to complete the solution of the
problem&mdash;to fix the position of the southern magnetic pole, as
that of the northern had been already fixed. The parties in
this noble rivalry are Great Britain, France, and the United
States. The British magnetic expedition, under Captain
James Ross, sailed on the 5th of May for Van Diemen’s Land.
The only notices as yet received of its progress are, that soundings
were obtained at the depth of 3600 fathoms in the South
Atlantic, about 900 miles S.S.W. of St Helena; and again at
the depth of 2680 fathoms, at 450 miles west of the Cape of
Good Hope. A dispatch from Captain Dumont d’Urville,
commandant of the French expedition, to the Minister of the
Marine, details all the leading particulars of his voyage, by
which it appears that he has nearly though not altogether
succeeded in solving this part of the problem. On the 1st of
January the expedition sailed from Hobart Town in a southern
direction for 1350 miles, and in the latitude of 60 degrees
south met with the first island of ice, and shortly afterwards
discovered land ranging nearly along the south polar
circle, and, as far as the navigator’s observations went, between
136 degrees and 142 degrees east longitude. The
appearance was that of an ice-bound, barren coast, wholly
unfit for the habitation of man. The snow and ice which
covered it gave its surface an almost level appearance. Farther
inward nothing was to be perceived but ravines, inlets,
and projections, without a trace of vegetation. Whales, large
porpoises, fur-seals, albatrosses, and petrels and penguins of
different species, were seen near the shore. The commander
gave this newly discovered coast the name of Terre Adelie.
“This name,” he says in his dispatch, “was intended to perpetuate
the remembrance of my profound gratitude for the
devoted companion who has three times consented to a long
and painful separation, to enable me to achieve my projects of
foreign exploration.” On the 1st of February, in 65 degrees
20 minutes south latitude, and 131 degrees east longitude, the
expedition crossed the meridian of no variation; and the magnetic
observations afforded the means of determining that the
position of the magnetic pole must be in the neighbouring land
of Adelie itself, or on the compact ice which adjoined it. Having
so far succeeded in attaining the main object of his mission,
Captain Dumont bade a final adieu to these dreary
regions, and steered for Hobart Town, where he arrived on
the 17th of February, after an absence of forty-six days, having
lost sight of the ice altogether in the parallel of 57 degrees
south latitude.</p>

<p>The American expedition, under Captain Wilkes, has been
equally successful in discovering the south polar island or
continent, for its geographical character has not yet been ascertained.
The land was first seen in 64 degrees 50 minutes
south latitude, and 154 degrees 18 minutes east longitude, by
a singular coincidence precisely on the same day, 19th January,
that it had been observed by the French navigator; and
Wilkes was enabled to run along the shore, for about 1700
miles, as far as 97 degrees 45 minutes east longitude, so near
the land as often to find soundings with a few fathoms of line,
and to be able to carry away several valuable geological specimens
of the rocks and soil. His description of the appearance
of the coast corresponds with that already given.</p>

<p>Whether any immediate beneficial results, practically applicable
to the improvement of commerce and colonization, will
accrue from these discoveries, may be doubtful, but the experience
of the era in which we live forbids us to reject the
prospect of ultimate benefits to society from any discovery
tending to enlarge the bounds of science, though the means by
which they are to be sought for are still out of sight. The
discovery of the extensive line of coast ranging nearly along
the south polar circle, serves in some degree to realize the conjectures
of former geographers, who, observing that by much
the greater mass of known land was in the northern hemisphere,
laid down the position that there must lie a countervailing
quantity of land somewhere in the southern hemisphere; so
fully convinced were they of the existence of this fancied continent,
that in the maps constructed by Herman Moll and other
scientific artists of his time, the coast is laid down in a line
nearly corresponding in latitude with that of Terre Adelie,
and continued round the globe, so as to represent the whole
of the south frigid zone as a continent, on which they inscribe
the name of Terra Australia Incognita&mdash;the unknown
southern region. With those who originated the supposition,
this unknown region was a mere creature of the imagination.
They were in possession of no facts to prove its reality; yet
it is singular that in this, as well as in many other fictions,
the ideal creature of the fancy has been discovered to have
some foundation in the realities of existence.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Paying down upon the Nail.</span>&mdash;The origin of this phrase
is thus stated in the Recollections of O’Keefe the dramatist:&mdash;“During
the Limerick assizes I saw a stuffed glove, about
four feet long, hanging out from the top of the Exchange,
nearly across the main street; this was the accustomed token
that for a week or a fortnight, whilst the courts were sitting,
no debtor could be arrested. Debtor or creditor, this was a
good thing for the theatres, as during that time the city was
thronged. An ample piazza under the Exchange was a thoroughfare:
in the centre stood a pillar about four feet high, and
upon it a circular plate of copper about three feet in diameter;
this was called <em>the nail</em>, and on it was paid the earnest for
any commercial bargains made, which was the origin of the
saying, ‘Paid down upon the nail.’” Perhaps, however, the
custom was common to other ancient towns.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">General Use of Tea in China.</span>&mdash;In China an ardent
spirit is made from rice, and called sam-shu, of which punch
is made in a coffee-pot, and it is drunk out of China cups;
but the natives are not much addicted to its use, a simple infusion
of tea being the general beverage of all classes. At all
hours of the day the artisan, as he sits at work, has his little
tea-pot and miniature cup beside him, out of which he quaffs
a little at pleasure, or presents a cup to his visitor. The
more refined class make the infusion in cups, in the manner
already described. After this process, as nothing is allowed
to go to waste in China, the tea-leaves are collected, dried,
and rolled up again, and sold to the English and Americans,
under the denomination of hyson mun-dun-go; that is, tea
having neither taste nor smell. None of this tea is sold in
England under its proper name, being for the most part mixed
with other kinds, and thus brought into the market. I never
saw green tea used in the houses of the natives, or of the
Fanqui merchants, where of course the best kinds were to be
had. The fact is, the consumption of green tea is for the
most part confined to the lower orders and the opium smokers,
who require its stimulating effects to settle the disturbed
state of their nervous system; and with us it is found to correct
the effects of an over-dose of opium&mdash;<cite>Dr Fulton’s Travelling
Sketches.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Progression.</span>&mdash;He that is good may hope to become better&mdash;he
that is bad may fear that he will become worse; for
vice, virtue, and time, never stand still.&mdash;<cite>Colton.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4">“A great lie,” says the poet Crabbe, “is like a great fish
on dry land; it may fret and fling, and make a frightful bother,
but it cannot hurt you. You have only to keep still, and it
will die of itself.”</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
